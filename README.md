This repository collects my work studying bayesian statistics. 
The book used is Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath

# Building a bayesian model 
1. Data story: motivate the model by narrating how the data came to be
2. Update: educate the model by feeding it the data
3. Evaluate: all statistical models require evaluation, leading to model revision.
